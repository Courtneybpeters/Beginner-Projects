# Beginner-Projects
This is a collection of small practice programs that I am choosing to use in order to get some hours in of writing my own code.

I originally stumbled upon this list based off [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/31p2p3/heres_what_i_recommend_to_absolute_beginners/) reddit post intended for beginner programmers. That article which had several good points included a link to [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TyqD2_oDtiQIh_Y55J5RfeA91JJECc97xYIKM112H9I/edit) document of good beginner projects.
